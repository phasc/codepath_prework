## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [v] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [v] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
  >I used mostly https://www.w3schools.com/ to help me with the syntax for the code

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
  >I think the biggest challenge for me was that I haven't done web dev with javascript in a long time, so I had to always try to remember the proper syntax for the code. The online ressources helped me a lot remembering all that and transferng my skills from other coding languages to this one.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  >I think my biggest question regarding web developement is more on the community side of it. The whole reason why the web exists is to connect people across the world. So how can we turn a application like this one into a community? How can we use this a fairly simple tool like this and make it into a place where people can interact? I think that is the beauty of the internet, people connecting with each other.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
 >If I had more time I would implement 2 things. First, a select your difficulty button, where easy mode would be slow, 3 lives, only 4 buttons, repeat until 8. Medium would be the game like it is now. And Hard is where the fun begins, you have 1 life, the speed increases on a logarithmic scale, after every 5 turns a new button is added, you can have infinite turns. The second feature relates to that, having infinite turns means that you can have a highscore to compare with other people, so I would put this online and create a small community where you can see who has the highest scores and comment on them.
